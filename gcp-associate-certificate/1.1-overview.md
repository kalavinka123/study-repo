### Overview and Cloud regions/zones
#### Why is the need for cloud computing?
It is difficult to make a plan for peak capacity that is significantly higher than the average workload.
When the peak season ends, the purchased servers are left idle for most of the year.

Public clouds offer a rental of compute capacity, with which the retailer provisions(rents) resources when they want them and release them back to the cloud when they don't need then. **on-demand resource provisiong** **the pay-as-you-go model**

#### Google Cloud regiones and zones
##### Regions
Google provides more than 20 regions around the world; for example, London, Mumbai, Sydney. It is important to have multiple regions for high availability, low latency, global footprint meaning that once an application is deployed in one region it can easily be deployed into other regions, and for adhering to government regulations because a country may order that the data generated inside the country be kept in the country.

##### Zones
Zones help achieve high availability in the same region. In the Google Cloud Platform, one region has at least 3 zones. Each zones has one ore more discrete cluters, that is, data centers.

##### Example
|Region Code|Zone List|
|---|---|
|us-west1|us-west1-a us-west1-b us-west1-c|
